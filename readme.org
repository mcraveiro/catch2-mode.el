* Catch2 Mode

Very simple emacs mode to display Catch2 unit tests. Displays the overview at
the test suite level and allows you to drill down into individual test cases.
You can navigate to the source code location for the test with =f= and, if
you follow our approach for naming logs, you can also open the log file
associated with the test.
